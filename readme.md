# AudioSnap — audio metadata at your fingertips

AudioSnap is a project that strives to make audio metadata fetching easier by utilizing audio fingerprinting algorithms and making use of extensive audio metadata storages. The primary goal of this project was to get familiar with audio recognition algorithms and techniques.  

AudioSnap project is composed of 3 key components:
- AudioSnap microservice — the current repository
- [AudioSnap client] — utilizes this microservice to fetch audio metadata
- [Chromaprint library] — included in both the microservice and the client

The inspiration for the project comes from [this article][chromaprint article], that goes deep into audio recognition algorithms that formed the basis of the following web APIs our project relies on:
- [AcoustID] — recognize audio by its fingerprint
- [MusicBrainz] — fetch audio metadata by its ID, relies on AcoustID
- [CoverArtArchive] — fetch link to audio cover art, relied on MusicBrainz/AcoustID

## Disclaimer

> Although **there ARE solutions to the problem** provided by AcoustID and MusicBrainz themselves (e.x. [MusicBrainz Picard]), our project's goal was to — again — get familiar with the audio fingerprinting algorithms and build something that can be used as a convenient mean of providing metadata to audio files, analagous to solutions provided by MusicBrainz and AcoustID.  
Our goal was not to build a counterpart OR competitor to these solutions by any means, as our solution strongly relies on their services and their audio fingerprinting algorithms. Neither was our goal to monetise the application, even though it is allowed on a paid basis.  
Same goes to the rewritten [open-source chromaprint library][original chromaprint lib], which is basically the implementation of the audio fingerprinting algorithms described in [this article][chromaprint article]. The goal was to get familiar with the algorithms, and we believe that the best way to learn is to practise.
